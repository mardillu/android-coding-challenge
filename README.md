# Vien Health Android coding challenge

## Tasks

There's a series of tasks to complete for the coding challenge.
Make sure you **add unit tests** for code that you write!
 
In no particular order, the tasks are:

#### 1. Add pagination
The source data comes from [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) so you can tweak the URL to read `?_page=2&_limit=20` (for example) to make the data paginated.

Bonus: leave some comments in the code around this specific way of paginating, and if there are any issues you can see by fetching "page 1", "page 2", and limiting.

#### 2. Fix broken tests
There are some unit tests that are broken, fix them.


## What we are looking for

Please don't spend more than 3 hours on the test, we understand that your time is important.

- Clear, easy to read, self-documenting code.
- Clear, concise, and easy to read unit tests.
- Consistency with existing code: Architecturally, semantically, and idiomatically.
- Commit history: we should be able to follow how you approached the problem, what the iterations were, and how roughly long it took.
- Task completion.

If you would like to leave any feedback, please edit the README, and leave your comment below here:
## Comments
I came across some inline comments in the source code that seem to be action points such as the one in the `showPosts(posts: List<Post>)` in the `PostsActivity` class
and `render(state: PostDetailScreenState)` in the `PostDetailActivity` class. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to act on those comments since they were not mentioned in the
task list in this file.
Anyways, I fixed the one in the `PostsActivity` class
